## 🚀 Backend – Setup & Run

### 1. Go to backend folder
```bash
cd backend
2. Install dependencies
bash

npm install
3. Start the server
bash

node server.js
# or
npm start   
Default Backend URL

http://localhost:4000
🗄️ Database & Tables
db.js creates the SQLite database file automatically:

js

const dbPath = path.join(__dirname, 'database.sqlite');
It will automatically:
Create employees and tasks tables (if they don’t exist)

Insert sample employees and sample tasks if tables are empty

Resetting the Database
If you modify schema, simply delete:

bash

backend/database.sqlite
Restart server → DB will be recreated with fresh structure and sample data.
